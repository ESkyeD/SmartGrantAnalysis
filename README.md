# SmartGrantAnalysis 
<span style="font-size:0.5em;">
### Description: This is a series of Text Analyses I did to compare Raleigh Municipal Government's Grant Draft to previous years winners, but there were a couple issues with the project... Initially my goal was to figure out how to design our Grant to maximize acceptance odds, but I only recieved winning Grant Applications and thus had no comparison point, thus the extent of the project became focused on key sentences in Winning Grants that could be applied to my work. I utilize R in this project and utilize the following
TF-IDF(Removed, Irrelevant)
Glove-Model
